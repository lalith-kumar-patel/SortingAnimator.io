This project is a Web Visualization tool for sorting algorithms.

#How does animations work?
While the array is being sorted, we push some indexes of the array and boolean values into animations array. These indexes are the indexes of the comparing element and final positioned element; Now, this animations array is passed to function which basically changes the color and size of the bar of the indexes in animations array. These changes are being done through a setTimeout() function to let the change be delayed and visible.
